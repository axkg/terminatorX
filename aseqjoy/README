What it does: Each axis of the joystick device is mapped to a specific MIDI 
controller. Moving the joystick along an axis will cause aseqjoy to emit
MIDI controller messages via ALSA's sequencer API. The value of the controller
message represents the joystick's position along the axis (eg 'left' -> 0, 
'middle' -> 63, 'right' -> 127).

aseqjoy uses the ALSA sequencer API to emit the MIDI events. Therefor it
creates and output port named after joystick used. You can then use for example
aconnect (from alsa-utils) or Robert Ham's alsa-patch-bay to connect an aseqjoy
instance to an input port of your choice. 

Requirements:
-------------

- Linux System with correctly configured Joystick support.
- A working ALSA 0.9 installation.

Howto:
------

In some cases the joystick may not utilize the full range of available 
controller values - in this case you should use "jscal" from the joystick
pacakge (most distributions feature this package) to calibrate your joystick 
before running aseqjoy. Note: Analog PC joysticks are no high-precision 
devices - so even after calibrating the device you might not always be able
to reach "0" or "127" controller values - depending on the joystick you
use.

Start aseqjoy - if you have a working Joystick (Nr. 0 - use the -d switch to
select other joysticks) aseqjoy will detect that and each axis to a controller
from 10 on upwards:

Axis -> Controller
   0 -> 10
   1 -> 11
   2 -> 12
   
From now on aseqjoy emits events over the "Joystick0" output port. To make use
of these events in another application use for example the alsa-patch-bay
to connect that output port to another application's input sequencer port
(for example the "terminatorX" input port for terminatorX). After you bound
the controllers to certain controls you should see how moving the joystick
affects the corresponding control.

Have Fun,
