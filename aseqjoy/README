aseqjoy is a simple Joystick -> MIDI controller converter. 

What it does: Each axis of the joystick device is mapped to a specific MIDI 
Controller. Moving the joystick along an axis will cause aseqjoy to emit
MIDI controller messages via ALSA's sequencer API. The value of the controller
message represents the joystick's position along the axis (eg 'left' -> 0, 
'middle' -> 63, 'right' -> 127).

aseqjoy uses the ALSA sequencer API to emit the MIDI events. Therefor it
creates and output port named after joystick used. You can then use for example
the alsa-patch-bay to connect an aseqjoy instance to an input port of your
choice. 

Requirements:
- Linux System with correctly configured Joystick support.
- A working ALSA 0.9 installation.

Howto:

Start aseqjoy - if you have a working Joystick (Nr. 0) aseqjoy will detect
that and each axis to a controller from 10 on upwards:

Axis -> Controller
   0 -> 10
   1 -> 11
   2 -> 12
   
From now on aseqjoy emits events over the "Joystick0" output port. To make use
of these events in another application use for example the alsa-patch-bay
to connect that output port to another application's input sequencer port
(for example the "terminatorX" input port for terminatorX). After you bound
the controllers to certain controls you should see how moving the joystick
affects the corresponding control.

Have Fun,
