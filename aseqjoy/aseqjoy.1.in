.SH NAME
aseqjoy \- Joystick to ALSA MIDI Sequencer Converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aseqjoy
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Aseqjoy maps each axis of a joystick device to a specific MIDI 
controller. Moving the joystick along an axis will cause aseqjoy to emit
MIDI controller messages via ALSA's sequencer API. The value of the controller
message represents the joystick's position along the axis (eg \'left\' \-> 0, 
\'middle\' \-> 63, \'right\' \-> 127).

Aseqjoy uses the ALSA sequencer API to emit the MIDI events. Therefor it
creates and output port named after joystick used. You can then use for example
\fBaconnect\fR or the \fBalsa-patch-bay\fR to connect an aseqjoy instance to an 
input port of your choice.

\fBNote:\fR Some joysticks may have to be calibrated (with \fBjscal\fR) before 
they can be used efficently. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Display help info
.TP
\fB\-d [joystick]\fR
Select the joystick to use for aseqjoy, where \fB[joystick]\fR is an integer value
from from 0 to 3 effectivley selecting devices js0 to js3.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode - aseqjoy will output information about the MIDI events
sent.
.TP
\fB\-0 [controller]\fR
Select the MIDI controller ID for axis 0. As a default value aseqjoy will use
10 + the axis ID, so for axis 0 that would be 10 + 0 = 10.
.TP
\fB\-1 [controller]\fR, \fB\-2 [controller]\fR, \fB\-3 [controller]\fR,
Just like \fB\-0\fR this will set the controller IDs for axes 1, 2, 3.
.SH OPERATION
After aseqjoy has started successfully all motion detected by the selected 
joystick device will cause MIDI controller messages to be emitted via the 
corresponding ALSA sequencer output port. The controller IDs are either the
default values (10, 11, 12 ...) or the ones given as commandline options.

Pressing a joystick button will cause aseqjoy to switch the MIDI channel. On
startup channel '1' is selected. Pressing joystick button 2 will cause channel
2 to be selected. Other buttons work accordingly.
