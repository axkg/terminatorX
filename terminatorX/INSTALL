terminatorX INSTALL:
Copyright (C) 1999 by Alexander König <alkoit00@fht-esslingen.de>

Quickstart:
-----------

	If you want enhanced audio-file support or optimization don't
	"quickstart" but read the rest of this file.

	If you just cant wait any longer try:
	> ./configure
	> make install

Step 1: Configure terminatorX.
------------------------------

	If you want your compiler to optimize the binary, you need to set your
	environment variable CFLAGS to your needs BEFORE you run ./configure.

	for example:
	if use bash: > export CFLAGS="-O2"
	with tcsh:   > setenv CFLAGS "-O2"

	I use CFLAGS="-O7 -mpentium" btw. You'll need to have a "pentium-aware"
	compiler to use that though (egcs-pgcc).

	The configure Options:

		--enable-wavonly

		Since Version 3.2 the terminatorX configure script automatically
		enables sox and mpg123 support, if these programs are found on
		the target system. So to be able to load close to any audiofile
		simply ensure you have sox and mpg123 installed an run the
		configure script - if you want to use the builtin wav-loading
		routines specify --enable-wavonly. These will be enabled if
		sox is not found of course.
		
		WARNING: Loading mp3's usually takes quite some time and 
		requires a whole lot of memory! tX does not support on-the-fly
		mp3 decoding, and therefor the whole mp3 will be decoded (by
		mpg123) before tX can handle the data.
		
		--enable-scheduler
		
		This option is only intended for people who have audiobuffer
		underruns (clicks) with their desired latency settings.
		If you run terminatorX compiled with this option as root, the
		engine thread will be run with FIFO-scheduling policy at the 
		highest priority. This is somewhat dangerous I guess, as is
		running programs as root anyway ;) If you want everybody to
		run terminatorX as root (THIS IS DANGEROUS AND YOU SHOULD NOT
		DO IT) cd (as root) into the directory where you installed
		terminatorX (usually /usr/local/bin) and execute:
		
		> chown root terminatorX
		> chmod u+s terminatorX
		
		I WARNED YOU! Anybody who can run this binary can completely
		erase your hardisk. BE CAREFUL.
		
		--enable-closedev=no
		
		The old "KEEP_DEV_OPEN" flag. Still does the same thing: Once
		the audiodevice is opened it won't be closed until you exit
		terminatorX. Good for devices that click when opened.

		Just as an example my configure line is (works with bash only):
		> CFLAGS="-O7 -mpentium" ./configure 

Step 2: Build the binary.
-------------------------

	This one's easy:
	> make
	
Step 3: Install the binary:
---------------------------

	Just as easy:
	> make install
	
	You need root privileges though. If you don't have them simply copy
	the terminatorX-binary (in src/terminatorX) to a directory of your
	choice and run terminatorX form there.
