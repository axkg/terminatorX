This is free software see the COPYING file that came with this
distribution for details.

WARNING: TerminatorX comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This software is known
to lockup X11 or cause other problems under rare conditions. Don't use
it on production servers. You have been warned!

NEW: As the previous README was a pain to read I decided to move the
documentation to an SGML "manual". This distribution contains that manual as a
set of HTML files for easy browsing and a postscript version for printing.

    o ./README.PERFORMANCE  - Some hints on tuning terminatorX
    o ./doc/index.html      - The index for the HTML version of the manual
    o ./doc/manual.ps       - The postscript version of the manual
