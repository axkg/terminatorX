terminatorX THANKS:

I'd like to thank:

- All authors of: the GNU tools and libraries, the Linux kernel, XFree86,
                  sox, mpg123, the wav-tools, gtk+ and TCP/IP. 
		  It's obvious but: without their work there'd be no tX
	
- All contributors (see AUTHORS)

- All users who send feedback

In politically correct alphabetical order:
- Adam King <aking@lgh.com.au> a lot of smaller code contributions.

- Adrian Reber <adrian@fht-esslingen.de> for being the *BEST* Linux 
  sysadmin ;), for numerous code contributions and the fabrication of
  terminatorX-rpms.

- Andy Lo A Foe <andy@alsa-project.org> for good tips, autoconf inspiration
  and a really cool program: alsaplayer
  (checkout: http://www.alsa-project.org/~andy/)

- Arthur Peters <amp@singingwizard.org> for contributing the ALSA MIDI
  support

  Anti-Clip-Device (checkout his audio file library:

  no longer use

  temporarily available again
