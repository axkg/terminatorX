terminatorX TODO:

DISCLAIMER: I might implement some of these features in random order. You can 
accelerate development of a certain feature by sending me a patch ;)

High priority milestones:
-------------------------

I'd like to have this in 4.0:

- Now, that stereo LADSPA plugins are done, I'd really like to:
  Find a replacement for DGA mouse grabbing as that has some problems and 
  might be gone sometime from now.

Low priority milestones:
------------------------

This might come after 4.0:

- Implement a sequencer editor GUI to delete, copy & paste, edit event etc.

- Support other languages.

- Support multiple audio devices in parallel maybe?
