terminatorX TODO:

DISCLAIMER: I might implement some of these features in random order. You can 
accelerate development of a certain feature by sending me a patch ;)

High priority milestones:
-------------------------

I'd like to have this in 4.0:

- Write a JACK audio backend.

- Support stereo LADSPA plugins somehow.

Low priority milestones:
------------------------

This might come after 4.0:

- Implement a sequencer editor GUI to delete, copy & paste, edit event etc.

- Find a replacement for DGA mouse grabbing as that has some problems and 
  might be gone sometime from now.
    
- Support other languages.

--- Ok, the follownig points are already implemented:

- Rewrite the audio device layer, so that terminatorX operates at a fix block
  size - this will allow correct playback of sequencer events even if played
  back on a different soundcard then recorded.

- Support ALSA drivers and allow usage of multiple audio devices at the same 
  time.
  
- Switch the terminatorX set file format to XML so that sets recorded on one
  platform can be loaded on other platforms, too.
  
- Move the "main buttons" on the top right to a menu bar in order to get the
  GUI even more flexible.

- Provide a MIDI interface to terminatorX.

- Use libaudiofile, libvorbis, etc. for file loading to get rid of "piped
  loading" and accelerate loading of ogg and mp3 files this way.
