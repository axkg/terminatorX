terminatorX - ChangeLog
All changes were done by me (Alexander König) if not stated otherwise.
This is not a GNU-style ChangeLog but you sort of get the idea what was
changed.

[v3.73]
- Fixed a compilation bug ocurring on big endian systems only.
- Fixed the built-in wav loading routines for big endian systems (again).
- Finally traced down and fixed a long outstanding bug in the dial widget,
  the background of the dials is now drawn correctly.
- Ported terminatorX to gtk+ Version 2. The code for gtk2 will be enabled
  when gtk2 is detected by configure. To force terminatorX to use the good
  old gtk 1.2.x (x>=5) run configure with the '--disable-gtk2' switch.
  WARNING: gdkxft-users: gtk2 applications segfault when preloading
  libgdk_xft.so! So unset LD_PRELOAD and set GDK_USE_XFT=1 instead.
- Applied a patch from Adrian that brings lots of new stuff:
  - Debian package support (removed - Mike Furr now maintains an official 
                            Debain package for terminatorX)
  - enhanced GNOME integration
  - a manpage for terminatorX
- Included another gcc3 fix thanks to Gregor Riepl <seto-kun@freesurf.ch>
- Improved configure's compatibilty - it should detect pthreads more reliably
  and it should detect ladspa.h when located in /usr/local/include without
  /usr/local/include being contained in the include path.
- This release should compile and run on FreeBSD systems and possibly
  OpenBSD, too. Thanks for help and testing this goes to 
  Tilman Linneweh <tilman@arved.de>.
- Sequencer now refuses to play when no events available - and displays
  a dialog that suggests running the audio engine.
- De-uglified the terminatorX note dialog.
- Fixed gtk+2 signals for load file dialog
- Pre-listen support for mpg321
- Added a new auto-hiding "panel-bar" to which turntable control and audio
  panels can be minimized to.
- Cleaned up the turntables' audio panel for better looks and easier usage
- Rewrote the engine thread completely - unlike before the engine thread 
  is created on startup and kept alive until termination.
- terminatorX can now be run suid root - and it might even be safe. After
  creating the engine thread both terminatorX threads drop root privileges
  before evaluating any parameters or reading/writing files, etc. The problem
  is the pthread "manager thread" is out of control of terminatorX code - so
  I cannot tell that thread to drop privileges.
- Fixed Drag'n'Drop for GNOME 2
- Deleted tons of old outdated code in tX_engine.cc and tX_mastergui.cc

[v3.72]
- Applied a patch from Matthew Evans <activesx@hotmail.com> that introduces 
  support for Ogg Vorbis audiofiles. It requires ogg123 > RC2 and sox to work.
  Autodetection is supported via configure (--enable-ogg123).
- Experimental support for input devices other than the core-pointer
  under XFree86 > 4. This uses the xsetpointer executable that comes with
  XFree86. configure should autodetect this correctly, in case it doesn't
  use the --enable-xetpointer switch.
- Adrian sent me a patch introducing two new buttons: mute and solo. As it
  didn't fully harmonize with the sequencer I rewrote parts of it and added new
  functionality to the turntables: They can now be switched to mix_solo or
  mix_mute - these settings affect current mixing only - their values will
  neither be saved nor will changes to those control be recorded in the
  sequencer - if you want to record muting events either use the mute button
  from the turntable's trigger menu, the keyboard short-cuts (alt/strg), or
  your middle mouse button.
- fixed a bug that produced corrupt wavfiles on big endian machines
- some minor fixes to make terminatorX compile with newer gcc releases
- Well, I am allowed to change my mind, aren't I? Anyway, 3DNow! is back.
  Nevertheless newer gcc releases seem to have a bug in handling movq and
  the current 3DNow! stereo implementation does not seem to be very efficient.
  So use --enable-3dnow only if you want to help me improve perfomance.
- Modified the mpg123 loader in order to make it work with mpg321, too.
  mpg321 lacks support for mpg123's -m switch ("singlemix") therefor 
  mpg?2?'s output is now piped into sox to convert the signal to mono.
  For this reason mpg?2? support now requires sox to be installed, too.
- added a workaround for a gtk+ bug that causes empty labels when strings
  contain umlauts - unluckily my name features one of these so I had to write
  this workaround.

[v3.71]
- applied a big patch from Adrian Reber (adrian@lisas.de). This patch includes:
  o compile fixes for the newer gcc releases
  o enhancements to the commandline switches (try --help for more details)
  o bug fixes for tX_global.c
- the bigNewThang (TM) is STEREO output. The Pan-Buttons now actually do what
  you'd expect them to. Therefore your soundcard must have stereo support of
  course but I guess in 2001 this really shouldn't be a problem, right? 
  The recorded wavfiles will now be stereo wavfiles of course.
  Note that stereo output means double audio-bandwith, so if you tuned your
  old terminatorX setup to smallest latency you might get clicks now. You can
  easily fix this by increasing the buffer size in the options dialog by one - 
  this will result in the same latency as before btw.
- The echo effect has undergone some enhancements to profit from the new stereo
  output. It's signal will now be mixed seperately so you can choose a different
  stereo panorama position for the echo signal. So the new echo effect now 
  features it's own PAN-knob. This does have some sideeffects though, for more
  details on this check the manual.
  Additionally the echo effect now has it's own volume setting to influence
  the dry/wet ratio of this effect.
- Some LADSPA effects tend to create NAN (Not A Number) float values under
  certain conditions. This is bad as all following operations will result in 
  NANs, so there will be no audio output no more. Now I will not introduce code
  to check for NANs as this is a waste of CPU-power, producing NANs is IMHO
  a faulty behaviour for LADSPA plugins and it should be fixed in there.
  Now a problem with the previous release was that the echo and lowpass effects
  "ate" those NANs resulting in NANs in those effects' buffers. So once a NAN
  got in there these effects caused the whole audio output to mute (forever). 
  Which is why I now introduced some code to clear the buffers in echo and
  lowpass whenever you dis- and reenable them.
- The GUI does have two master vu-meters now. The turntable's still have one
  vu-meter only. Note that the echo-signal is *not* included in the turntable's
  vu-meter now, as it's mixed seperately.
- The 3DNow!-Optimizations are gone. And they'll proabably never come back as
  I don't have time to maintain the same algorithm twice.
- The documentation has been updated to meet the new features. A lot of typos
  have been fixed as well.

[v3.70]
- this list may be incomplete
- This release brings support for LADSPA plugins. These plugins can be inserted
  into any turntable's effect chain at any position. You can edit the the
  effect sequence with the two tiny blue arrows. The builtin effects reside in
  the same effect chain as LADSPA plugins, but unlike LADSPA plugins they cannot
  be removed (nor multi-instanciated).
  The LADSPA plugins have to "fit" into the effect chain, which is why
  terminatorX supports *mono* plugins (plugins that have one audio-in and one
  audio-out port) only. For the plugin's control ports, termintatorX supports
  all HINTS except for LADSPA_HINT_LOGARITHMIC. Some control ports might be 
  hard to handle as LAPDSA control ports can have very wide value ranges. It is
  possible to enter precise values though.
  Get LADSPA and the CMT plugins from http://www.ladspa.org
  All parameters for LADSPA-plugins are "sequencable parameters", so you can
  record parameter-change events for the plugin's knobs just as for the
  standard parameters.
- GUI re-design to support dynamic plugin GUIs. The audiofile-display is now 
  seperated from the turntable's controls. The groups are split in to panels
  which can be minimized if not required (orange arrow). The panels'
  minimized-status will be saved within the set files.
  To add a plugin effect into the turntables effect chain click on the "FX"-
  button and choose the plugin of your choice. To get more info on the
  plugin effects click on their panel's label.
  NOTE: The panning-control is not working yet. It'll work as soon as stereo
  is done.
- As always when introducing something new, the set-file file-format has
  changed.
- The parameter-to-mouse-axis mapping has been moved from hardcoded to
  dynamic. You can now map any parameter that's considered "mappable" to the
  mouse-axis of your choice (for each turntable separately). This is true
  for the control ports of LADSPA-plugins, too.
- Josh Steiner <joschi@eds.org> has joined terminatorX development. For this 
  release he has added some startup parameters for terminatorX, some of them
  aiming for future MIDI support, and therefor not functional yet. Run
  "terminatorX --help" to get more details.
- I know write the "manual" in SGML with the DocBook DTD. The distribution
  contains the HTML and the postscript version. These transformation have been
  created using James Clark's jade (DSSSL-processor) and Norman Walsh's DSSSL
  stylesheets for DocBook.
- Removed obsolete "number of vtts"-option from the options dialog.
- Applied a patch from Josh that fixes running the soundfile editor for files
  including a blank in their filename.
- New tooltips for the complete GUI.

[v3.61] (unreleased)
- applied a tiny patch from Atsushi Yamagata <yamagata@plathome.co.jp>
  to set locale on startup.

[v3.60]
- terminatorX has a sequencer now. Warning: with the current design the
  sequencer will correctly play back recorded events only when the buffer size
  (of the audio device) is set to the same size as it was when recording the
  events. I know this is annoying and I will try to find a solution to this. 
  Please take a look at the README to find out how the sequencer works.
- fixed a bug causing the lowpass filter produce a constant signal
- fixed the load file / drag'n'drop segfault bug
- fixed the prelisten zombie processes bug
- fixed the segfault on termination bug (with the audio engine running)
- hacked the mixer code to use 3DNow! too. This improves 3DNow! performance gain
  from previously ~6% to more than 20% (depending on compiler optimizations)
- extended the set-file-format to allow storing of sequencer events. This
  release allows loading old tX-sets too.
- some gui icons. Choose Text/Icon / Icon only / Text only display of these
  icons in the Options dialog. You'll have to restart tX to see the changes
  though.
- "soundfile-editor support": Enter the soundfile-editor of your choice in the
  tX-Options dialog (Still looking for an editor? Checkout Dave's Linux
  Sound and MIDI Pages: http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linuxsound/).
  Click the edit button in the Main-Panel to start your editor with the
  turntable's soundfile - edit ;) - save and click the reload button.
- big endian bug fixes by Scott C. Knight <scknight@indiana.edu>
- --enable-benchmark will now produce a benchmark binary. This takes a set file
  as a parameter (that set file should autotrigger all tables, else the
  benchmark will measure how fast tX can generate zeros ;) WARNING: the
  benchmark binary is not a usable terminatorX binary.
- a new dial-widget. I created this for the upcoming GUI-redesign - and decided
  I let you debug it right now ;) If you don't want it run configure with the
  --disable-dial switch.
- some gui redesign. The volume scales are now located near their corresponding
  "flash"-widget. This release fits into very small windows - so it should be
  usable on smaller displays as well.
- Adrian told me configure doesn´t have to check for glib after checking for
  gtk+ - I guess he´s right so the glib-test has gone.
- more minor fixes
  
[v3.55]
- implemented "sequenceable parameters" (see tX_seqpar.*). This means the
  groundwork for the sequencer is done. Although this release does not yet
  feature a sequencer - there's still a profit: you can now see the GUI (e.g.
  the lowpass-freq slider) update while you change that value with your mouse in
  dga grab mode (e.g. up/down with the default X/Y-Control settings).
- fixed (libmmx) mmx.h to work with gcc 2.95 and above
- fixed compilation problems for big endian machines. still runtime probs
  reported though.
- fixed configure-script as the new bash complains about == in string compares
- fixed some gui segfaults
- added an ugly GNOME-mimetype installer. This installs the ".tX"-mime type, an
  terminatorX-application icon and a ".tX"-icon. I could use some hints on how
  I could make automake install that instead of an extra script.
  (see README.GNOME)
- added Drag'n Drop support. Works with the great gmc. Drop an audio file over 
  the filename-button or the wavdisplay of a turntable to load it into that
  table. Drop an audiofile over the "Add Turntable" Button to create a new 
  turntable and load that file into that turntable. Drop a tX-set file over the
  "Load Set" button to load the set. 

[v3.51]
- fixes the load_piped() compilation error if you use neither sox nor mpg123.
  Note that you have no "pre-listening" without mpg123 for mp3s and no 
  "pre-listening" for any other file without sox.

[v3.5]
- Yet another redesign ;) Oh well this project moved from c++/multithreaded
  to c++/singlethreaded, to c/multithreaded and now, finally, back to
  c++/multithreaded. This shows quite some foresight, I'd say ;)
- Due to the redesign I had to change a lot (everything?) again so this document
  can impossibly hold all changes. but let's see:
- tX now uses floats instead of doubles for a lot of parameters. Therefore the
  old .terminatorXrc.bin is now called .terminatorX3rc.bin to allow parallel
  use of older releases. But you'll have to configure the new release again
  the first time you run it.
- tX now supports an unlimited no of turntables. The only limit is your display
  really.
- Each of these turntables has their own pitch / volume settings and a 
  dedicated lowpass and echo effect section.
- You can now map mouse motion to a function of your choice (scratching/
  volume/cutoff/echo-feedback and nothing)
- Recording will now happen straight to disk. You'll have to specify a filename
  before you start recording.
- You can sync the turntables to one master turntable.
- There are two master settings for pitch and volume available to modify all
  turntables. The turntable pitch is relative to the master pitch.
- You can save a complete set (of turntables and settings) to a .tX set file.
  The audiofile data will *not* be saved within that file, but it'll contain
  the absolut filename to these files. I know this makes the act of exchanging
  sets over the net more complex so if somebody wants to code set files with
  integrated audio data... ;)
- The way audiofiles are loaded has been redesigned too: the builtin wav
  routines, the sox support and mpg123 are no longer connected. This means
  you can use mpg123 support without sox support and still have the builtin
  wav routines enabled. If you have the builtin wav reader and sox enabled, tX
  will try try to use the builtin routines first, and if they fail sox will be
  used as a fallback which is of course slower as you know... There's some 
  support for Benno Senoner's brilliant 3.2-mmap() patch but the patch still
  needs to be ported.
- You can now select which parameter to map to a mouse axis.
- experimental 3DNow! support (works with gcc < 2.95 only)
- tX-windows now have an icon, thanks Michael!

[v3.2]
- implemented 2D-Scratching ;) You can now use the other axis of your mouse
  two modify the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter (if enabled). The
  resonance factor can be set via the slider underneath "LP Filter". Seems
  to eat quite some CPU power though...
- Updated THANKS, AUTHORS
- as most people seem to use sox/mpg123 anyway and as I still get "I want mp3"
  emails I changed the configure script slightly: It now automatically enables
  the use of sox and mpg123 if these are available. If you still want 'em good
  old 16Bit/44.1Khz/Mono builtin routines you have to specify --enable-wavonly
  with your configure cmdline.
- Prepared the tarball for the Win32 port. You can now compile tX with cygwin
  and the Makefile.cygwin in the src directory if you have all the required
  libs (gtk, pthreads etc...). The resulting exe will run BUT is completely
  unusable for now... Stou Sandalski <tangui@cell2000.net> and I are planning
  to make it usable in the future.
- The About-Dialog now contains some info on how the binary was compiled

[v3.1]
- Optimized audio-rendering code for speed (might run on some machines
  with smaller buffsize (-> lower latency) than pre-3.1) - Hey, tX now uses
  less than 10% CPU (says kpm) with mixing enabled on my i586-200MMX machine!!  
- "fixed" stdout-output. Due to the pipe-buffering realtime schratching can
  not be considered usable for now :(
- Added config option --enable-scheduler, which will cause the terminatorX
  engine-thread to run with FIFO scheduling policy and highest priority. This
  might enable some machines to use smaller buffsizes. It requries root
  privileges though - either run terminatorX as root - or make terminatorX
  suid root WHICH IS A BAD IDEA FOR MULTI-USER SYSTEMS IF OTHER USERS CAN
  ACCESS THE BINARY ;) You only have to think about this when you experience
  buffer underruns with your desired latency. And it might not even help...
- Rehacked the de-clicking (fading) code. The old one tried to be much more
  intelligent - and failed fading out the signal sometimes. The new code
  is much simpler (faster) and is much more reliable.
- added common sense to the warp feature (f-key in scratch mode). The warping
  speed is still connected to the mouse speed but it's now adjusted to the
  sample size as well: you can warp through any sample completely with the same
  mouse distance.
- added debug configure switch. Enables (very few) debug messages for now. I
  decided not to enable the old V2.X messages as they are sent to stdout, which
  would sound pretty strange to people who use the stdout-option.
    
[v3.02] (unreleased)
- Fixed Adrian's name in the THANKS file. Sorry, Adrian.
- Corrected Makefile.am for license.c that did not build correctly on some 
  systems - Thanks to Michael Pruett <mikep@ugcs.caltech.edu>

[v3.01]
- fixed a bug that caused terminatorX to crash without --enable-sox or
  mpg123input.

[v3.0]
- Changed everything ;)
- switched from C++ to C for gtk's sake
- switched back two multithreading
- implemented new gtk+ gui and dialogs
- new mouse-sampling code now uses DGA's DirectMouse
- implemented "initalizing"-support for XInput devices.
- new (alpha) "pre-listening" feature in scratch/loop dialogs
- hacked vtt for click-free audio. Might be problematic with big
  kernel level buffersizes but scratching with big buffsize is no
  fun anyway.
- options are now stored in ~/.terminatorXrc.bin automatically (on exit)
  as well as windowsize and the last used filenames
- terminatorX now comes with a configure script - no more Makefile hacking
  required (nor a good idea ;) )
- new wavdisplay-widget update frequency is now configureable
- new position-display is much more visible which allows more precise
  scratching
- new mute-feature allows you to silence the scratch-playback completely
  while the loop keeps playing (press either <m>-key or right mouse-button.
- support for mouse buttons:
  o 1. (left) button: same as <SPACE>, do scratch
  o 2. (right) button: mute scratch
  o 3. (middle) button: stop
- wrote support for sox and mpg123. This enables terminatorX to read close
  to any audiofile. You need to have sox and mp3 and this feature (as it is
  still alpha) needs to be enabled via configure-switches see INSTALL
- licmak now is an awk script. Thanks Christian! I was also received two perl
  scripts (Thanks, guys!) but I now use the awk script as it is the smallest.
- introduced <F>-key to "warp" through scratch-sample (just check it out)
- dropped commandline arguments
- dropped old X-Code + Mouse warping madness
- bug fixes (less than bug introduces though ;) )


[v2.4] (unreleased)
- implemented a time counter
- licmak now finally is what it should be: a perl script (licmak.pl)
  it was contributed by: Adam Sjøgren <asjo@diku.dk>. Thanks!

[v2.3]
- X-Window background fixed
- wavfile overreading fixed by Andrew C. Bul+hac?k (acb@zikzak.net)
- Using portable type definitions now where required. If you don't
  have a <sys/types.h> on your system and your machines type sizes
  equal those of an X86-machine you can specify -DUSE_X86_TYPES in
  Makefile to compile without <sys/types.h>
- Slight change in audiodevice-handling that fixes improper buffsize
  settings on some soundcards (e.g. GUS)
- Implemented "keep device open"-feature. Needs to be enabled via the
  -DKEEP_DEV_OPEN switch in Makefile
- Added some comments to the Makefile for easier editing
- Added Big Endian support. Use -DBIG_ENDIAN_MACHINE for big endian hosts
  like ultrapenguin suns or linux ppc. There's also -DBIG_ENDIAN_AUDIO
  for big endian audio hardware (rare?) available, although proabably
  nobody will need this.
- Changed mix behaviour: Mix is now automatically turned on on startup if
  the user has specified a proper loop file. (with the --loop or -l switch)
- New mixing routine. You can now set the loop to scratch volume ratio with
  the cursor keys (left/right). If you modify the volumes while recording
  these action's will not be recorded. Saving happens with the currently
  set level.
- Fixed README-Bug said <m> instead of <x>
  
[v2.2]
- first released version
- added colors. more standard use of X11.
- added loop support.
- added statusbar with mode/status display
- added commandline options and help (on usage and keys)
- added raw/mixed save scratch feature
- added licmak to include license into binary
- new handling of XAutoRepeat, only turned off now when SPACE pressed.
- modified wave display (faster + nicer + incorrect (who cares anyway))
- Makefile fixed by Adrian Reber (adreit00@fht-esslingen.de)
- bug fixes
