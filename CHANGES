terminatorX - History
All changes were done by me (Alexander Koenig) if not stated otherwise.

[v2.3]
- X-Window background fixed
- wavfile overreading fixed by Andrew C. Bul+hac?k (acb@zikzak.net)
- Using portable type definitions now where required. If you don't
  have a <sys/types.h> on your system and your machines type sizes
  equal those of an X86-machine you can specify -DUSE_X86_TYPES in
  Makefile to compile without <sys/types.h>
- Slight change in audiodevice-handling that fixes improper buffsize
  settings on some soundcards (e.g. GUS)
- Implemented "keep device open"-feature. Needs to be enabled via the
  -DKEEP_DEV_OPEN switch in Makefile
- Added some comments to the Makefile for easier editing
- Added Big Endian support. Use -DBIG_ENDIAN_MACHINE for big endian hosts
  like ultrapenguin suns or linux ppc. There's also -DBIG_ENDIAN_AUDIO
  for big endian audio hardware (rare?) available, although proabably
  nobody will need this.
- Changed mix behaviour: Mix is now automatically turned on on startup if
  the user has specified a proper loop file. (with the --loop or -l switch)
- New mixing routine. You can now set the loop to scratch volume ratio with
  the cursor keys (left/right). If you modify the volumes while recording
  these action's will not be recorded. Saving happens with the currently
  set level.
- Fixed README-Bug said <m> instead of <x>
  
[v2.2]
- first released version
- added colors. more standard use of X11.
- added loop support.
- added statusbar with mode/status display
- added commandline options and help (on usage and keys)
- added raw/mixed save scratch feature
- added licmak to include license into binary
- new handling of XAutoRepeat, only turned off now when SPACE pressed.
- modified wave display (faster + nicer + incorrect (who cares anyway))
- Makefile fixed by Adrian Reber (adreit00@fht-esslingen.de)
- bug fixes
