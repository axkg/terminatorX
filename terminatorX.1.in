.B terminatorX
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch" on
digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.) the way hiphop-DJs
scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple turntables, realtime effects
(buit-in as well as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer and an easy-to-use
gtk+ GUI.
