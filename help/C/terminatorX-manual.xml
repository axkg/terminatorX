      <title>Turntable Controls</title>

      <para>The turntable GUI contains multiple controls and the real 
      time displays for each turntable. To save some space on your 
      desktop and to give terminatorX the traditional audio-application 
      look, terminatorX features "knob"-widgets. These widgets work 
      pretty straight-forward: click somewhere within the widget and 
      keep the left mouse-button pressed. Now move the mouse up and 
      down or left and right to increase/decrease the control's value. 
      All those widget are coupled with a text entry field since 3.70, 
      which allows you to enter values directly.</para>

      <para>A turntable is visualized by two panels: the control and 
      the audio panel. These are no longer combined for better layout 
      management.</para>

      <para>Sometimes you might find a certain audio or control panel 
      unnecessary - simply eating up space. Since release 3.73 it is 
      possible to minimize audio and control panels to the 
      <emphasis>panel bar</emphasis> with the tiny button with a blue 
      bar icon in the upper right edge of each panel. This bar works 
      just like GNOME's window list or KDE's kicker: When a panel is 
      minimized a button in the bar will appear, representing the 
      minimized window. On clicking this button the button will be 
      removed and the minimized panel is displayed again. When no 
      panels are minimized the panel bar automatically disappears to 
      save display space.</para>

            in grab mode the parameters you selected from this menu 
            will be affected (for this turntable). Since Version 3.70

              <para>Using two (or more) loops and terminatorX'

              For precisely cut loops this usually means making them 
              run equally fast or one running twice as fast as the 
              other etc. Manually finding the necessary pitch values 
              usually consumes a significant amount of time so the 
              feature <emphasis>Pitch Adjust</emphasis> helps speeding 
              up this process.</para>

              <para>Clicking this button will cause the

          TerminatorX can record events for nearly all parameters of a 
          turntable. All of these so-called "sequencable" parameters 
          have an extra pop-up menu since Version 3.81. Simply 
          right-click on the knob, button, slider of the parameter you 
          want to setup, and a menu with the following options will 
          appear:

              <para><emphasis>MIDI Learn</emphasis></para>

              <para>This options provides an easy method to select the 
              MIDI control to modify the parameter you select. If you 
              choose this menu entry, a tiny dialog box will pop up 
              that reads <emphasis>"Waiting for MIDI 
              Event..."</emphasis>. The first MIDI event terminatorX 
              receives will now be mapped to control this 
              parameter.</para>

              <para>This option can be turned either on or off: when 
              enabled the maximum value of the MIDI controller will be 
              mapped to the minimum value of the controlled parameter 
              and the other way round.</para>

              <para>Note that this allows mapping a MIDI controller as 
              a crossfader: simply map the same MIDI controller to two 
              different turntables's volume controls (or optionally 
              extra amplifier plugins) and reverse one of these MIDI 
              mappings.</para>

              <para>Sometimes it is preferable to modify a certain

              be achieved with this option - by setting an upper and a 
              lower bound for the MIDI control of this parameter. When 
              you select this menu entry, the current setting of this 
              parameter will be used as the upper bound for the

        <title>The Effect Queue</title>

        <para>With release 3.70 the effects are no longer hardcoded 
        into the turntable. The effects are now arranged within an 
        per-turntable effect-queue. Additionally Version 3.82 
        introduces a second effect-queue that follows the first: the 
        queue for stereo LADSPA plugin effects. The effect sequence is 
        configurable by the user. To move an effect to higher position 
        within the queue, press the <emphasis>blue upward arrow 
        button</emphasis>. This will cause the effect to be rendered 
        <emphasis>before</emphasis> the following effects. The 
        <emphasis>blue downward arrow button</emphasis> will move the 
        effect down by one position. It will then be rendered 
        <emphasis>after</emphasis> the preceding effects.</para>

        <para>There are two types of effects: the traditional built-in 
        effects (Lowpass and Echo) and LADSPA plugins. The built-in 
        effects are always available and cannot be removed (but 
        disabled). There can be only one instance of a built-in effect. 
        The LADSPA plugins on the other hand may be instantiated 
        multiple times and can be removed from the effect queue. Press 
        the <emphasis>blue cross button</emphasis> to achieve 
        this.</para>

        <figure>

          <title>An example for a terminatorX effect queue</title>

          <graphic fileref="figures/signalflow.png" format="PNG"/>
        </figure>

        <para>Now since release 3.71 the built-in echo effect is 
        treated differently from other effects. Where all other effects 
        feed their signal back into the effect queue the echo effect 
        doesn't touch the input signal. It's echo-signal is mixed 
        separately from the turntable's main signal to allow a 
        different panning value for the echo-signal. This mode of 
        operation does have some side-effects: imagine a lowpass filter 
        with a position after the echo effect in the effect queue. This 
        will result in the turntable's main signal being 
        lowpass-filtered but it will leave the echo-signal 
        lowpass-unfiltered.</para>

        <para>Some may call this behaviour a bug - whereas I would 
        consider it a feature ;). Anyway if the above description 
        didn't clear things up maybe the displayed figure does. It 
        shows a schematic effect queue with the built-in effects and 
        two LADSPA effects enabled. Now with this setup you will not 
        hear anything from the second LADSPA effect in the 
        echo-signal.</para>

        <para>Release 3.82 introduces a menu for each LADSPA plugin. 
        Simply click on the Plugin's label to operate the menu. Aside 
        of displaying detailed information about a plugin, the menu 
        also contains some new functionality: <emphasis>Add Dry/Wet 
        Control</emphasis>. When activated the effect receives an extra 
        Dry/Wet control that allows you to modify to what extent the 
        effect will actually effect the turntable's signal. The extra 
        control doesn't differ from the other controls: you can record 
        events for it, etc. The additional control can be removed via 
        the very same menu item that adds the control.</para>

            Buttons</emphasis></para>

            <para>Press this button to load a LADSPA plugin into the 
            effect queue of the turntable. A menu holding the available 
            (terminatorX-"compatible") LADSPA-plugins will pop up - 
            mono plugins are available from the <emphasis>FX</emphasis> 
            menu, stereo plugins from the <emphasis>Stereo 
            FX</emphasis> menu. The plugins are grouped within submenus 
            according to the modules the plugins are contained in. 
            Simply select the plugin you want to load from this menu 
            and a panel for it will pop up at the end of the effect 
            queue.</para>

            <para>Note that due to the wide parameter ranges some 
            LADSPA plugins have they sometimes might be hard to control 
            with the knob widget. In these cases you might want to use 
            the text field to enter values. For more details on plugins

            playback cursor is half way through the sample. This is

            the stereo panorama that differs from the main panning 
            position of the turntable to achieve a somewhat spacial 
            effect. The easy example is: turntable's panning left, 
            echo's panning right. As both pan parameters are 
            sequenceable you can create nice motion effects from this 
            starting point.</para>

    <sect2 id="SYNCHRONIZATION">

      <title>Synchronization</title>

      <para>Let's start off with an example: Say you have two drum 
      loops and one bassline loaded in three turntables. Of course you 
      want these samples to be triggered at the same time but you don't 
      want to invest time to cut them to the exact length. Therefore 
      you decide which of the drum loops to make the sync master. 
      You'll have to do this before you enable the audio engine (for 
      now). Only one turntable can be the sync master. Now you can make 
      the other two sync clients which will cause them to be 
      (re-)triggered whenever the master is (re-)triggered. The number 
      you can select to the right of the <emphasis>client 
      button</emphasis> sets the trigger delay for the button: if it's 
      set to zero the turntable will be triggered with every master 
      trigger, if it's set to 1 it'll be triggered every 2nd master 
      trigger and so on.</para>

      <para>A nice side effect of this feature is: you can now scratch 
      the second (sync client) drum loop and no matter whether you're 
      scratching is good or not the beat will be triggered correctly 
      again ;)</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="GRABMODE">

      <title>Grab Mode Operation</title>

      <para>After pressing the <emphasis>Mouse Grab button</emphasis> 
      terminatorX enters "grab mode". This mode actually blocks the 
      mouse (as its input is now used to control the real time 
      parameters) and therefore you'll have to know some mouse/keyboard 
      shortcuts to control the software without the GUI.</para>

      <para>Press <keycap>ESCAPE</keycap> to quit grab mode.</para>

      <para>Select the turntable with input focus: The first turntable 
      to hold the input focus will be the first turntable. You can now 
      use <keycap>TAB</keycap> or right mouse button to switch to the 
      next turntable. Alternatively you can use <keycap>F1</keycap> to 
      <keycap>F12</keycap> to select turntable 1 to 12.</para>

      <para>Now the turntable that has the focus is the one you will 
      manipulate with your mouse and keyboard inputs: Note that you can 
      actually map different functions to the mouse x/y axis - so what 
      actually happens when you move your mouse depends on what you 
      select via the <emphasis>Mouse Mapping</emphasis> for each 
      turntable.</para>

      <title>Plugins (LADSPA)</title>

      <para>Since release 3.70 terminatorX supports LADSPA-plugins. 
      LADSPA is the "Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API" which 
      was designed by developers on the 
      Linux-Audio-Developer-Mailinglist and is maintained by Richard 
      W.E. Furse. For more information on LADSPA, other LADSPA-hosts 
      and LADSPA-plugins checkout the 
      <ulink url="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA homepage</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Not every plugin is supported by terminatorX though. As the 
      plugins are inserted into the per-turntable effect-queue, they 
      have to be mono or (as of Version 3.82) stereo plugins. This is 
      why terminatorX will load plugins with <emphasis>one</emphasis> 
      or <emphasis>two</emphasis> audio-in ports and 
      <emphasis>one</emphasis> or <emphasis>two</emphasis> audio-out 
      ports only.</para>

      <para>The decision on whether a plugin is terminatorX-suitable is 
      made on terminatorX startup, so only plugins that fit into the 
      effect queue will be offered in the mono plugin-menu that pops up 
      when the <emphasis>FX</emphasis> button is clicked or in the 
      stereo plugin menu when the <emphasis>Stereo FX</emphasis> button 
      si clicked. Depending on whether the terminatorX binary you're 
      using was built with or without liblrdf ( 
      <xref linkend="LIBLRDF"/>) support the plugin menu will either 
      contain sub-menus with plugin categories (with liblrdf) or just a 
      single menu with the <emphasis>Unclassified</emphasis> 
      category.</para>

      <para>On startup terminatorX will print some information on the 
      LADSPA-plugins analysis process to the standard output if you 
      have enabled "Verbose Plugin Loading" in the Preferences dialog. 
      Watch the terminal you run terminatorX from for that info if you 
      have problems loading a plugin.</para>

      <para>As specified in the LADSPA-standard LADSPA-plugins can be 
      located in multiple directories across the filesystem. To enable 
      LADSPA-hosts to find those plugins you have to set the 
      environment variable <envar>LADSPA_PATH</envar> accordingly. 
      Let's say you store your plugins in <filename>
      /usr/lib/ladspa</filename> and <filename>
      /home/yourlogin/plugins</filename> then you would have to 
      set:</para>

      <para><envar>LADSPA_PATH</envar>= <filename>
      /usr/lib/ladspa:/home/yourlogin/plugins</filename></para>

      <para>As a fallback terminatorX will look in the standard 
      directories <filename>/usr/lib/ladspa</filename> and <filename>
      /usr/local/lib/ladspa</filename> if the environment variable is 
      not set. Note that this is just a convenience-function, in order 
      for other LADSPA-hosts to work properly, be sure to set your 
      <envar>LADSPA_PATH</envar> correctly. It is a good idea to do 
      that from somewhere in your system configuration (either in your 
      rc-scripts or <filename>/etc/profile</filename> or wherever you 
      prefer).</para>

      <sect3 id="LIBLRDF">

        <title>liblrdf support</title>

        <para>Release 3.80 introduces support for Steve Harris' great 
        <ulink url="http://plugin.org.uk/releases/lrdf/">
        liblrdf</ulink> library which introduces an RDF based scheme to 
        categorize LADSPA plugins. This approach allows storing 
        additional meta-data for LADSPA plugins in separate RDF files. 
        In order to make use of these RDF files a terminatorX binary 
        (compiled with liblrdf support of course) requires the main 
        <filename>ladspa.rdfs</filename> file and additional RDF files 
        containing meta information about the LADSPA plugins installed. 
        Steve Harris' wonderful plugin library comes with such an 
        additional description file for example.</para>

        <para>By default terminatorX will search the directories 
        <filename>/usr/share/ladspa/rdf</filename> and <filename>
        /usr/local/share/ladspa/rdf</filename> for RDF files. In case 
        the files were installed to other locations it is possible to 
        configure the LADSPA RDF path in the <emphasis>Misc</emphasis> 
        tab of the <emphasis>Preferences</emphasis> dialog.</para>

        <para>If the RDF are read successfully on startup, the LADSPA 
        menu that pops up when clicking a turntable's 
        <emphasis>FX</emphasis> button will feature multiple sub-menus 
        with LADSPA plugin categories (eg 
        <emphasis>Amplitude/Amplifier</emphasis>) in which you will 
        find the according plugins. Plugins not categorized by the RDF 
        files reside in the <emphasis>Unclassified</emphasis> 
        menu.</para>

      <title>MIDI Interface</title>

      <para>Aside of controlling terminatorX with a regular mouse and 
      keyboard it is possible to control parameters through MIDI events 
      (since 3.80). The MIDI interface is based upon the ALSA sequencer 
      API. On startup terminatorX creates a MIDI input port called 
      "terminatorX". You can now use for example the 
      <ulink url="http://pkl.net/%7Enode/alsa-patch-bay.html">
      alsa-patch-pay</ulink> to connect an output port of your choice 
      (either a hardware MIDI input device or a software generating 
      midi events) to the terminatorX input port. If the 
      "<emphasis>Restore MIDI Connections</emphasis>" option is 
      activated terminatorX will try to re-connect to the MIDI ports it 
      was connected to with the last run. However this approach is 
      purely address-based and might fail miserably with software 
      ports, in this case just disable the configuration options 
      re-wire manually.</para>

      <para>

        There are two ways to map MIDI events to a parameter:
        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Via the <emphasis>Configure MIDI Bindings</emphasis> 
            dialog as described below</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Via the the a parameter's menu (see 
            <xref linkend="PARAMETERMENU"/>)</para>

          </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

      </para>

      <para>Once the connection is set up terminatorX receives MIDI 
      events through the input port. To configure what MIDI events will 
      have which effect on a terminatorX turntable you can bind MIDI 
      events to parameters of your choice by clicking the 
      <emphasis>MIDI</emphasis> button of the turntable's audio panel. 
      As a result the <emphasis>Configure MIDI Bindings</emphasis> 
      dialog will pop up which features a field labelled 
      <emphasis>Selected MIDI Event</emphasis> that will frequently 
      update to display the contents of the last MIDI event received by 
      terminatorX. So in order to map a MIDI controller to a specific 
      turntable parameter select the parameter of your choice from the 
      parameter list, cause your MIDI event sending device to emit the 
      event you want to map the parameter on and click the 
      <emphasis>Bind</emphasis> button.</para>

      <para>Immediately after binding the event you should see that the 
      <emphasis>Event</emphasis> column entry of the selected parameter 
      is updated to match the selected event. From now on all events 
      matching the selected event will cause the turntable parameter to 
      be updated. The GUI for that parameter will be refreshed 
      accordingly. Note that it is possible to map the same event to 
      multiple parameters.</para>

      <para>The MIDI mappings are stored within terminatorX set files 
      so you wont have to reconfigure your bindings every time you 
      start up terminatorX. If you are unhappy with a chosen binding 
      you can select the parameter and click the <emphasis>Remove 
      Binding</emphasis> button to get rid of the parameter's MIDI 
      mapping.</para>

      <para>TeriminatorX now features a default MIDI mapping that can 
      be enabled via the <emphasis>Turntables Menu</emphasis> (see 
      <xref linkend="TURNTABLESMENU"/>). The controllers are mapped in 
      a one channel per turntable fashion:</para>

      <para>TerminatorX Version 3.81 brings support for the 
      <emphasis>JACK Audio Connection Kit</emphasis>. Instead of 
      writing audio data directly to some audio device terminatorX can 
      send data to the JACK Daemon for further processing.</para>

      <para>To use the JACK backend you have to ensure that the JACK 
      Daemon is up and running before you start terminatorX. The JACK 
      backend is only available if terminatorX was capable of 
      connecting to the JACK Daemon on startup. By default the two 
      output ports of terminatorX will be connected to physical ports 
      if available. You can then re-wire the ports whatever way you 
      want. They will not be deactivated - when terminatorX' audio 
      engine is turned off, the audio backend emits continuous 
      silence.</para>

  <sect1 id="CONFIGURATION">

    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>The main terminatorX configuration parameters can be set up

    activated from the terminatorX menu. The new 
    <emphasis>Preferences</emphasis> dialog features multiple tabs for 
    several aspects of configuration.</para>

    <para>A word on the settings in general: your settings are stored 
    in an XML file ( <filename>~/.terminatorXrc</filename>). So if you 
    think you completely messed up your settings you will have to exit 
    terminatorX - delete this file - and then re-run terminatorX with 
    the default settings. Note: is this file is now an XML file you can 
    edit with an editor of your choice.</para>

    <sect2 id="AUDIOTAB">

      <title><emphasis>Audio</emphasis> Tab</title>

      <para>This tab allows to select which audio backend terminatorX 
      should use. Currently there are three options: the OSS (Open 
      Sound System) backend, the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound 
      Architecture) backend and the JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit) 
      backend. Some of these options might not be available, if your 
      terminatorX binary wasn't compiled to support a certain 
      backend.</para>

      <para>The OSS and ALSA backends have dedicated configuration 
      tabs, JACK requires no further configuration - for more details 
      on JACK support see <xref linkend="JACKSUPPORT"/>.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="OSSTAB">

      <title><emphasis>Audio: OSS</emphasis> Tab</title>

      <para>Select the audio device you are going to use from the 
      available options (or simply enter one yourself). terminatorX 
      renders audio block-wise. In order to achieve close-to-realtime 
      performance it is necessary to keep this blocks as small as 
      possible. The main parameters that determine how 
      close-to-realtime terminatorX will perform are <emphasis>No. of 
      Buffers</emphasis> and <emphasis>Buffersize</emphasis>. The 
      <emphasis>No. of Buffers</emphasis> parameter determines how many 
      buffers the audio driver should use in most cases 
      <emphasis>2</emphasis> should be the best setting and in rare 
      cases <emphasis>3</emphasis> might give better results.</para>

      <para>The value for the <emphasis>Buffersize</emphasis> setting 
      will be evaluated as 2^buffersize by OSS. So if you set the value 
      to <emphasis>8</emphasis> the actual buffer size will be 2^8=256 
      Bytes. The smaller the buffers' size the better terminatorX will 
      perform. The default setting of <emphasis>9</emphasis> should be 
      acceptable in most conditions, but if you here "clicks", or 
      "drops" in audio output that are not related to your 
      sample-material you will have to increase the buffer size. On the 
      other hand if you believe terminatorX does not react fast enough 
      you have to decrease this parameter.</para>

      <para>Additionally you can select the sampling rate you want 
      terminatorX to operate on - note that recording to disk will use 
      the same sample rate.</para>

      <para>Using ALSA for audio output allows specifing the buffer

      The <emphasis>Buffer Time</emphasis> option lets you set the size 
      for the complete ring buffer, while the <emphasis>Period 
      Time</emphasis> determines how many audio samples will be 
      transferred to the audio device per cycle. I'm not really sure on 
      what kind of settings to recommend, however I had best results 
      when setting the <emphasis>Period Time</emphasis> to 3rd or half 
      of the <emphasis>Buffer Time</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>It's advisable to set the <emphasis>Buffer Time</emphasis>

      report when they have stopped. This is why terminatorX assumes 
      your mouse has stopped if there is no motion reported for certain 
      amount of render/output-cycles. This value is configurable via 
      the <emphasis>Stop-sense-cycles</emphasis> option. If you 
      decrease your buffersize of course you shorten the cycle time as 
      well, therefore if you here strange stop/run behaviour of the
