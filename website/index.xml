        <para>For those of you who drop by for the first time: terminatorX is a
        realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch" on digitally
        sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.ogg, *.mp3, etc.) the way hiphop-DJs
        scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple turntables, realtime
        effects (buit-in as well as 
        <link ref='http://www.ladspa.org'>LADSPA</link> plugin effects), a
        sequencer and MIDI interface - all accessible through an easy-to-use
        gtk+ GUI. 
        <bold>This sofware is designed to run under Linux, FreeBSD and the
        like</bold>. If you have more questions read the

          <para>This terminatorX release does a very good job at extinguishing
          points from my TODO-for-4.0 list. Among other things this release
          introduces:

              <para>Finally terminatorX has a

              <bold>backend</bold>. See the new 
              <italic>Preferences</italic> dialog and the online manual for
              details. The ALSA and the OSS backends now both support operating
              at an 
              <bold>arbitrary sampling rate</bold>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>The audio data display is now 
              <bold>zoomable</bold>. This helps scratching large audio files
              (like complete songs) significantly. Use the slider on the right
              of the display area to adjust the zoom level. When playing the
              audio data will scroll in such a manner that the current position
              is always centered.</para>
              <para>To optimize playback performance terminatorX does a lot of
              "zoom" calculations in advance - so adjusting the slider will
              cause quite some amount of recalculation on large audio files.
              The focused turntable now has a blue background and a yellow
              audio signal instead of the old red border.</para>

              <para>A 
              <bold>MIDI interface</bold> thanks to a patch by

                <email>amp@singingwizard.org</email>
              </person>. The MIDI interface is based upon the 
              <link ref='http://www.alsa-project.org'>ALSA</link> sequencer API,
              so you'll have to connect terminatorX' input port to an output
              port of your choice with either 
              <screen>aconnect</screen> or for example the 
              <link ref='http://pkl.net/~node/alsa-patch-bay.html'>
              alsa-patch-bay</link>. To map a MIDI controller or note events to
              a turntable's parameter click the 
              <italic>MIDI Mapping</italic> button.</para>
              <para>In order to test the new interface I hacked a little tool
              called 
              <link ref='aseqjoy.html'>aseqjoy</link> that emits MIDI controller
              messages based on Joystick motion.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>I finally untied audio rendering and audio backend.
              terminatorX now operates at a 
              <bold>fixed internal blocksize</bold> of 1 ms. So now it doesn't
              matter anymore with which blocksize events were recorded - they
              will be played back correctly with any audio device
              blocksize.</para>
              <para>Note that a minor problem remains: the sampling rate has an
              effect on the blocksize, too. While there is no problem switching
              from 22 or 32 kHz to 48 kHz, there will be a slight rounding
              error switching from or to 44.1 kHz. So if you record and
              playback events I suggest you keep the sampling rate the same, or
              use "straight" sampling rates like 22, 32 and 48 kHz only.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>I added a little 
              <bold>pitch calculator</bold> that allows adjusting the playback
              speed of a turntable to that of the master turntable so it easy
              very easy to synchronize loops now. Note that this feature is
              proabably useless.</para>

              parameters will be stored within set files, too. As XML set files
              with a lot of sequencer events can grow quite big tX supports

              <para>I reworked the GUI a bit in order to make terminatorX fit
              better on those small DJ-laptop displays. Audio and control
              panels can now be minimized to a 
              <bold>panel bar</bold> to save space - works just like GNOME's
              window list. The panel bar status is stored within setfiles and
              restored upon loading. Additionally the buttons of the audio
              panel have been restructured. To lighten up the GUI five buttons
              have been merged into 
              <bold>two</bold> - on clicking one of these you'll get a popup

              <para>After spending an evening with Adrian in front of his big
              endian system fixing the audiofile loading routines, I decided
              that loading audiofiles through a pipe is an ugly hack. Therefor
              I wrote 
              <bold>three new audiodfile loading methods</bold> that utilize
              libraries instead of pipes. These are 
              <link ref='http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/'>
              mad</link> (for mp3 files),

              OGG/Vorbis files) and 
              <link ref='http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/'>
              libaudiofile</link> (for wav/aiff/au etc.). Using these routines
              instead of the old ones brings the following advantages:

              </itemizedlist>Additionally more file formats are supported, so I
              strongly recommend installing the libraries mentioned above to

              <bold>XML</bold>: the configuration file (now 
              <italic>~/.terminatorXrc</italic>) is no longer binary but an XML
              document. This is necessary to become more flexible in the future
              - and it allows editing your terminatorX configuration with a
              text editor - if you want to. Of course, terminatorX now requires
              
              <link ref='http://www.libxml.org'>libxml</link> to be installed.
              For convenience this release still reads the old binary config
              and stores it as an XML document on exit. I plan to move the set
              file format to XML soon, too.</para>

              <para>I completely rewrote the

              terminatorX 
              <bold>suid root</bold>. This way terminatorX can run with
              realtime scheduling policy even for unprivileged users. Right
              after creation of the engine thread terminatorX drops root
              privileges - so it might even be safe to install terminatorX suid
              root - but I'll leave that up to security experts to decide. For

              </person>terminatorX finally supports loading 
              <link ref='http://www.vorbis.com'>Ogg Vorbis</link> audiofiles.
              Note that this feature requires ogg123 (&gt;= RC2) and 
              <link ref='http://sox.sourceforge.net'>sox</link> installed. The
              very fresh RC3 release of Ogg Vorbis works just fine, too.</para>

              </person>once again submitted code to the project: terminatorX
              now features 
              <bold>mute</bold> and 
              <bold>solo</bold> buttons for each turntable's mixing unit. The
              initial patch had some problems with the already existing
              mute-function in terminatorX, therefor I extended the turntable
              in such a way that the new buttons 
              <bold>only affect current mixing</bold> - the sequencer will not
              record any events for them.</para>

              <para>I updated the XInput code to work with XFree86 &gt; 4.
              terminatorX now uses the 
              <italic>xsetpointer</italic> binary that comes with XFree86 to
              switch the core pointer - as the old code doesn't work with newer
              XFree86 releases anymore. 
              <italic>configure</italic> should auto-detect 
              <italic>xsetpointer</italic> if it's available. 
              <bold>Note:</bold> You only need to specify an additional XInput
              Device in the options dialog if you want to use a scratching
              device other than your mouse. (Yeah, I know, I state that in the
              docs, tooltips, everywhere - but I still get bug reports related
              to that issue...)</para>

          <para>Initially I planned to integrate native

          release but I simply failed to finish. As many people wanted to have
          some of the above features early I decided to release it without ALSA
          now, as I'll be busy for the upcomming weeks. I haven't given up on
          ALSA though, hopefully the next terminatorX release will feature a
          new audiodevice backend that supports ALSA (V0.9) 
          <bold>and</bold> OSS and brings many other adtvantages.</para>
