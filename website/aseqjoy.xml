  <aseqjoy>
    <para>
    <bold>aseqjoy</bold> is a 
    <italic>Joystick to ALSA MIDI Sequencer Converter</italic>. In fact it's a
    really tiny piece of software that turns a joystick into a MIDI controller
    for the 
    <dblink id='alsa'>ALSA</dblink> sequencer
    infrastructure. I mainly wrote it to test the new MIDI interface of
    terminatorX but then I thought it might be useful with other scenarios and
    applications, too.</para>
    <para>For a more detailed description on what it does and how to use it
    have a look the <dblink id='aseqjoy_man'>manpage</dblink>.</para>
    <para>If you want to test it yourself download the source: 
    <file>aseqjoy-0.0.1.tar.gz</file> (Sorry no
    binaries - but it's so small it only takes seconds to compile it yourself
    :) Compiling aseqjoy requires kernel and ALSA (asound library) headers to
    be installed.</para>
    <para>To compile and install it's really just the simple:</para>
    <para>
      <screen>tar xzf aseqjoy-0.0.1.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd aseqjoy-0.0.1
      &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</screen>
    </para>
    <para>To make full use of aseqjoy you might require jscal from the Vojtech
    Pavlik's 
    <link ref='http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/%7Evojtech/joystick/'>joystick
    package</link> (to calibrate your joystick) and Robert Ham's 
    <link ref='http://pkl.net/%7Enode/alsa-patch-bay.html'>
    alsa-patch-bay</link> or aconnect from the 
    <dblink id='alsa'>alsa-utils</dblink> package to connect
    aseqjoy's MIDI output port to other input ports.</para>
