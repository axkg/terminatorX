terminatorX TODO
================

DISCLAIMER: I might implement some of these features in random order. You can 
accelerate development of a certain feature by sending me a patch ;)

* Individual turntable colours (to easily identify which controls belong to
  which sample)
* Stereo turntables
* Drop audio loaders use gstreamer-based streaming instead.
* Implement a sequencer editor GUI to delete, copy & paste, edit event etc.
