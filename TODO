terminatorX TODO:

DISCLAIMER: I might implement some of these features in random order. You can 
accelerate development of a certain feature by sending me a patch ;)

- GTK3 port

- Find DGA replacement as X11 is about to vanish

- Stereo turntables
  
- Drop audio loaders use gstreamer-based streaming instead.

- Implement a sequencer editor GUI to delete, copy & paste, edit event etc.
