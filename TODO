terminatorX TODO:

These are the things I´d like to implement IF I have the time.
The position of an idea in this list represents it´s priority:

- add a marker feature: this will allow you to set 12 markers visually
  in the wavfile-display. These will be available via the F1-F12 keys in
  NORMAL and RECORD mode. If you press (and hold) one of these keys it will
  have the same effect as pressing space but if you release it it will
  jump to the position you marked in the wavfile. Easier scratching for people
  like me who don´t have any scratching skills.

- code cleanup: I guess this will be on this list until development has stalled.

DONE:

The following stuff has been on the list above and is now ipmlemented:

[V3.0]

- Enhance audio quality with -DHANDLE_STOP -> no clicks.

- Accept wavfiles that contain additional information (e.g. loops)

- Support Y-mouse-movement for scratching

[V2.4] Thanks to Adam Sjøgren <asjo@diku.dk> licmak.c is obsolete:

- implement licmak with either perl, awk or sed.


[V2.3] (use -DKEEP_DEV_OPEN in Makefile)

- add a "keep device open" option and implement it
  (this would help if you have problems opening device very often
  due to memory fragmentation). And it would help me ;) as my card (or better
  driver) clicks awfully when device is opened!

OBSOLETE:

[V3.0] no cmdline args anymore so...

- correct getopt error handling.
