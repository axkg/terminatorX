DISCLAIMER: I might implement some of these features in random order. You can 
accelerate development of a certain feature by sending me a patch ;)

- Now, that stereo LADSPA plugins are done, I'd really like to:
  Find a replacement for DGA mouse grabbing as that has some problems and 
  might be gone sometime from now.
  
- Drop audio loaders use gstreamer-based streaming instead.

- Implement a sequencer editor GUI to delete, copy & paste, edit event etc.

- Support other languages.

- Support multiple audio devices in parallel maybe?
