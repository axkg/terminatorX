terminatorX INSTALL:
Copyright (C) 1999, 2000, 2001 by Alexander König <alex@lisas.de>

Note: As of Version 3.70 you need to have LADSPA installed to compile
terminatorX.

Quickstart:
-----------

	If you want enhanced audio-file support or optimization don't
	"quickstart" but read the rest of this file.

	If you just cant wait any longer try:
	> ./configure
	> make install

Step 1: Configure terminatorX.
------------------------------

	If you want your compiler to optimize the binary, you need to set your
	environment variable CFLAGS to your needs BEFORE you run ./configure.

	for example:
	if use bash: > export CFLAGS="-O2"
	with tcsh:   > setenv CFLAGS "-O2"

	I use CFLAGS="-O3 -mathlon" btw. You'll need to have a
	"athlon-aware" compiler to use that though (gcc > 2.95.?).

	All of the following configure options can be either enabled with
	--enable-option or disabled with --disable-option.

	The configure Options:
	
		Performance Options:
		--------------------
		
		--enable-scheduler
		
		NEW: since 3.5 this option is enabled by default, as you can
		now operate the GUI while sound is playing, which can cause 
		audio dropouts when the GUI and the sound thread run at the
		same priority. You still need root privileges though.
		
		If you run terminatorX compiled with this option as root, the
		engine thread will be run with FIFO-scheduling policy at the 
		highest priority. This is somewhat dangerous I guess, as is
		running programs as root anyway ;) If you want everybody to
		run terminatorX as root (THIS IS DANGEROUS AND YOU SHOULD NOT
		DO IT) cd (as root) into the directory where you installed
		terminatorX (usually /usr/local/bin) and execute:
		
		> chown root terminatorX
		> chmod u+s terminatorX
		
		I WARNED YOU! Anybody who can run this binary can completely
		erase your hardisk. BE CAREFUL.
						
		File support options:
		---------------------
		
		All of these are enabled by default. Nevertheless the configure
		script checks for the availability of the helper application
		and if it's not found disables support for it. Check the
		terminatorX homepage for links to those apps if you don't have
		them - or check your distribution first, AFAIK all bring these
		tools nowaday.
		
		--enable-wav
		
		This enables the builtin wav routines. They load 16Bit/44Khz
		MONO RIFF/WAV files only but they do that significantly faster
		than using sox. If these routines fail and sox support is
		enabled, terminatorX will try to load the file with sox as 
		a fallback. Disable them only if they don't load your files
		correctly.
		
		--enable-sox
		
		This enables sox support. As sox can load nearly any audio file
		it makes sense to use it. You have to have sox installed of 
		course.
		
		--enable-mpg123
		
		This enables mpg123 support. If you want to be able to load mp3
		files keep this option enabled. You have to have mpg123
		installed of course.
		
		--enable-ogg123
		
		With this option you can turn on/off support for Ogg Vorbis
		soundfiles. This requires ogg123 (Version >= 1.0RC2) and
		sox to be installed. 
		
		Misc options:
		-------------

		--enable-3dnow
		
		This will cause the binary to include 3DNow! accelerated 
		mixing routines. The rule's simple: if your CPU does support
		3DNow! then turn it on (it enhances performance quite a bit)
		- if your machine doesn't, well then keep it disabled. A binary
		created with 3DNow! acceleration will *not* run on machines
		without 3DNow!.
		
		--enable-debug
		
		This will cause terminatorX to display some debug messages on
		your console. 
		
		Just as an example my configure line is (works with bash only):
		> CFLAGS="-O3 -mathlon" ./configure 

Step 2: Build the binary.
-------------------------

	This one's easy:
	> make
	
Step 3: Install the binary:
---------------------------

	Just as easy:
	> make install
	
	You need root privileges though. If you don't have them simply copy
	the terminatorX-binary (in src/terminatorX) to a directory of your
	choice and run terminatorX form there.
